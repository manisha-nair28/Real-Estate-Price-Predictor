## Problem Statement
 Implement a Multi-variate Linear Regression after finding your own data 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on different properties such as transaction date, house age, latitude, longitude, and other features. 
The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or incorrect data points.

## Code 
To use the Real Estate Price Predictor, simply run the [`Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/manisha-nair28/Real-Estate-Price-Predictor/blob/main/Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb) script. The script will then output the predicted price of the property based on the trained model.
